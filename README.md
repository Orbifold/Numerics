This portable class library contains algorithms and utilities related to **machine learning, mathematics, finance and numerical methods**. Being a PCL it can be used in any .Net project and for iOS or Mac development via Xamarin.

The library was developed over many years as part of [Orbifold's consultancy](http://www.orbifold.net) in a wide range of domains and businesses. 

This library is also (partially) ported to **Swift** (native iOS) and can be found here on Gtihub as well, see the [XAct library](https://github.com/Orbifold/XAct).
